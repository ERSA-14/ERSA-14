# Hi , I'm Saksham Gupta

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm coding and building projects that solve Real-World problems.

# Working Philosophy

Let's be real: deep down, we know we are a model built on societal values and human values. My personal approach is to break down problems into several foundational problem statements. I curiously deep dive into each problem statement, build a solid foundation, and create a personal interpretation for it. By doing this recursively, I solve real-world and complex problems.
