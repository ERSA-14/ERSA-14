# Hi , I'm Saksham Gupta

I'm coding and building projects that solve Real-World problems.

# Working Philosophy

Let's be real: deep down, we know we are a model built on societal values and human values. My personal approach is to break down problems into several foundational problem statements. I curiously deep dive into each problem statement, build a solid foundation, and create a personal interpretation for it. By doing this recursively, I solve real-world and complex problems.

## Technologies & Dev Tools

- **Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript, Typescript, SQL
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, React, Next, Node, Express
- **Databases:** MySQL, Oracle DB, Postgres
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, Antigravity, vs-code, linux 
- **Cloud:** AWS Cloud, Google Cloud

## What I'm Working On

- Building innovative and scalable web applications
- Learning new frameworks and technologies
- Improving my real world problem-solving skills through coding challenges


## Currently Learning

- Advanced Algorithms & Data Structures
- Cloud architecture & DevOps practices
- Machine learning & AI Concepts.
